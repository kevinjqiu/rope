``a python refactoring library and IDE ...``


Overview
========

*rope* is a python refactoring IDE and library.  The IDE uses the
library to provide features like refactoring, code assist, and
auto-completion.

It is written in python.  The IDE uses `Tkinter` library.  Note that
rope ``0.5`` was the last version that supported Python ``2.4`` and
currently rope requires Python ``2.5``.
