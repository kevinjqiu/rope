``a python refactoring library ...``


Overview
========

*Rope* is a python refactoring library.  It supports many refactorings
and features (see status_ section).

*Ropeide* is an IDE that uses *rope* library to provide features like
refactoring, code assist and auto-completion.  It uses `Tkinter`
library.

*Ropemacs* is an Emacs mode for using rope library in emacs.  It uses
Pymacs_.

Note that rope ``0.5`` was the last version that supported Python
``2.4`` and currently rope requires Python ``2.5``.
