Get Involved!
=============

Rope was started because of the lack of good refactoring tools for
python.  But after observing python IDE limitations we grew bigger
ideas in our heads.

If you want to have a more powerful python IDE and have big ideas
in your head, you are welcome to get involved.


How to Help Rope?
=================

* Use rope.
* Report bugs and request features in `rope project page`_.
* Submit patches for bugs or new features.
* Discuss your ideas in `rope-developers`_ mailing list.

.. _rope project page: http://sf.net/projects/rope
.. _`rope-developers`: rope-developers@lists.sourceforge.net


Wish List
=========

If you're interested you are welcome discuss your ideas in
`rope-developers`_ mailing list or send your patches.  Here is only a
list of suggestions.

A New GUI
---------

Right now rope uses Tkinter for its GUI.  But Tkinter, as many have
complained about, looks very bad and is not suitable for writing an
IDE.  The UI parts of rope, ie. `rope.ui` package, is a layer on top
of other core parts of rope.  When I started rope I hoped that someday
the IDE and UI parts of rope (`rope.ui` and `rope.ide` packages) would
be developed by other developers and I still do hope so.  So if you're
interested in working on GUI/IDE part of rope using something like
`pygtk` or `wxPython` you're welcome.

Formatting
----------

You can format python source code.  This probably needs using ASTs and
writing them.

Detecting Warnings
------------------

This might include detecting unused variables and imports or
unreachable statements.  `rope.base` can help, too.  Currently rope
only detects redefined elements.

Modules Without Source Code
---------------------------

Rope cannot know anything about python C extensions and compiled
modules without matching source code.  Some information can be
gathered using `inspect` module.  But that is not safe but better than
nothing.  This requires a good knowledge of `rope.base`.


Rope Structure
==============

Rope package structure::

  rope
    base
    refactor
    ide
    ui

Have a look at ``__init__.py`` of packages for finding their
description.  Also have a look at `library.txt`_ for a few
examples.

.. _`library.txt`: library.html


Submitting patches
==================

We're always grateful for patches to Rope's code.  Indeed, bug
reports with associated patches will get fixed *far* more quickly
than those without patches.

Patch style
-----------

Always use the latest version of files from rope Subversion repository
from https://rope.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rope

* Submit patches in the format returned by the ``svn diff`` command.
* Follow :PEP:`8`.
* Use four spaces for indentation.
* Include good unit-tests if possible.
* Rope test suite should pass after patching (``python runtests.py``).
