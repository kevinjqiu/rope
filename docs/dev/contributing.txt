Get Involved!
=============

Rope was started because of the lack of good refactoring tools for
python.  But after observing python IDE limitations we grew bigger
ideas in our head.

If you want to have more a powerful python IDE and have big ideas
in your head, you are welcome to get involved.


How to Help Rope?
=================

* Use rope.
* Report bugs and request features in `rope project page`_.
* Submit patches for bugs or new features.

.. _rope project page: http://sf.net/projects/rope


Rope Structure
==============

Rope package structure::

  rope
    base
    refactor
    ide
    ui

Have a look at ``__init__.py`` of packages for finding their
description.


Wish List
=========

Right now rope uses Tkinter for its GUI.  But Tkinter, as many has
complained about, looks very bad and is not suitable for writing an
IDE.  The UI parts of rope, ie. `rope.ui` package, is a layer on top
of other core parts of rope.  When I started rope I hoped that
someday the IDE and UI parts of rope (`rope.ui` and `rope.ide`
packages) would be developed by other developers and I still do hope
so.  If you're interested, start sending patches or if you want to
use some other graphical library like wxPython send a basic but
working UI.


Submitting patches
==================

We're always grateful for patches to Rope's code.  Indeed, bug
reports with associated patches will get fixed *far* more quickly
than those without patches.

Patch style
-----------

Always use the latest version of files from rope Subversion repository
from https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rope

* Submit patches in the format returned by the ``svn diff`` command.
* Follow :PEP:`8`.
* Use four spaces for indentation.
* Include good unit-tests if possible.
* Rope test suite should pass after patching (``python runtests.py``).
