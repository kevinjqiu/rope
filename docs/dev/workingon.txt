* Remembering last restructuring

* Updating docs
* Changing the default font on linux to courier?
* Updating and adding docs on SOI

* Lots of exceptions for `PyFunction`
* Commenting based on the line of syntax error in codeassist?
* Adding restructuring scope; local scope, module, all files?
* Better search triggering in find type dialog
* Changing `codeanalyze.WordFinder` to use ASTs?
* Refactoring codeanalyze; lots of estimations
* Assignment to parameters in inline method

* Extracting subexpressions; look at `extracttest` for more info
* Remove ``change occurreces`` refactoring?
* Changing version format?

Remaining Small Stories
=======================

Base:

* Multiple ropes on one project; problems for objectdb and history
* Inline fails when there is an arg mismatch
* Evaluate function parameter defaults in staticoi?
* Recursive SOI; Go where the calls go with limited depth
* Adding ``do when unsure`` config to all refactorings?
* Removing ``pass`` when introducing factory for empty classes
* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow

UI and IDE:

* Inserting common prefix when using codeassist
* Renaming files, folders, modules, and packages in project tree view
* Completion in module entries
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Comments should be indented

Docs:

* Explain why rope does not stop users from performing wrong
  refactorings
* Add custom refactoring section to ``overview.txt`` file;
  Extract field refactoring
* Document why support for Python ``2.4`` was dropped
