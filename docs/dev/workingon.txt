Basic Inline Method
===================

- Occurances in defining module
- Raising exceptions for function calls in lines that contain other
  statements
- Goto definition for '(a_var.\nattr)\n' for attr
- Extract variable for selections starting from the start of the line
- Renaming parameters to match parameters passed in call context
- Default parameters
- Testing badly formatted text
- Handling class methods
- Handling ``return`` statements
- Lonely ``return``
- Multiple ``return``\s
- Keyword and list parameters
- Caching calculated definitions
- Test other calls as parameters
- References to functions other than calls
- Recursive calls

Remaining Stories
=================

* Adding ``overview.txt``, ``README.txt``, ``tutorial.txt`` and
  ``COPYING`` to help menu; Adding readonly mode?
* Problems for renaming vars in `__init__.py` of packages!
* ``How to use rope as a library`` doc
* Better `ropetest` package structure
* Decide when to use `difflib` in `Editor.set_text`
* Changing `uihelpers` tree and list to support mouse clicks
* Handling `AssList` for inline variable and encapsulate field
* Changing refactor modules to use `sourcetools.add_methods`
* Adding ``add_statements(method, statements)``
* Changing `Rename` to take an `OccuranceFinder`
* Caching `Occurrence` fields
* ``break`` and ``continue`` in extract method

* Considering logical lines in `rope.codeanalyze`
* Reporting unhandled exceptions as error dialogs in the GUI
* Better move dialog; complete modules names; use `editor._CompletionListHandle`
* Moving/renaming current module/package
* Extract method and return statements
* Import addition when adding a relative with an absolute import
* Caching `PyCore.classes`
* Handling `Scope.lookup` for ::

    class A(object):
        a_var = 10
        another_var = a_var

* Preferring `DefinedName`\s in attribute code assists
* `rope.exceptions` should only contain user exceptions that are
  thrown from public classes like `Project`, `PyCore`, `Refactoring`
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
