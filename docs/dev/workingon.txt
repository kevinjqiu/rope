Cleanups
========

* Method inlining and pydocs
* What to do if a file is removed while editing
* A separate module for `ResourceObserver`\s
* Moving observing implementation from `Resource` to `Project`
* Allowing non-existent resources
* Add ``revalidate the whole project`` to file


Remaining Stories
=================

* Problems for inside generator assists
* Performing actions on individual functions or imports
* `PyClass.superclasses` should be concluded data
* Better `ropetest` package structure
* Decide when to use `difflib` in `Editor.set_text`
* Handling `AssList` for inline variable and encapsulate field
* Changing `Rename` to take an `OccuranceFinder`
* ``break`` and ``continue`` in extract method

* Considering logical lines in `rope.codeanalyze`
* Reporting unhandled exceptions as error dialogs in the GUI
* Better move dialog; complete modules names; use `editor._CompletionListHandle`
* Moving/renaming current module/package
* Extract method and return statements
* Import addition when adding a relative with an absolute import
* Caching `PyCore.classes`
* Handling `Scope.lookup` for ::

    class A(object):
        a_var = 10
        another_var = a_var

* `rope.exceptions` should only contain user exceptions that are
  thrown from public classes like `Project`, `PyCore`, `Refactoring`
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
