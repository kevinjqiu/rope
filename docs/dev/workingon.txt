Performing Import Actions On Individual Imports
===============================================

* Adding an function to `ImportTools` method that returns `True` if
  action can be performed on the import statement passed to it.

  - Filtered expanding stars
  - Filtered relative to absolute

  * Filtered handle long imports
  * Filtered froms to normals

* Relative to absolute uses two phases; filtering problems
* Handle long imports should work on filtered imports unconditionally?

* Better name for import_filter
* Changing `rope.refactor.ImportOrganizer` to add offset -> import
  filter transformation? offset or line_number
* Think about the UI; Adding prefix?

* Should removing duplicate imports in froms to imports be changed?
* Removing relative to absolute or changing it to support ``from .
  import x`` style imports?
* Better handling of ``__init__.py``\s in change buffer
* Sorting items in find file or buffer list
* Refactor codeanalyze
* Adding an option to inline not to remove the definition
* Renaming ``rope.py`` to ``ropeide.py`` and ``~/.rope`` to
  ``~/.ropeide.py``?
* Changing the default font on linux to courier?
* Lots of exceptions for `PyFunction`
* Commenting based on the line of syntax error in codeassist?
* Adding restructuring scope; local scope, module, all files?
* Better search triggering in find type dialog
* Changing `codeanalyze.WordFinder` to use ASTs?
* Refactoring codeanalyze; lots of estimations
* Assignment to parameters in inline method
* Assignment to parameter warning

* Extracting subexpressions; look at `extracttest` for more info
* Remove ``change occurreces`` refactoring?
* Changing version format?
* Using similarfinder in introduce_parameter?
* Should we move generate to `rope.base.refactor`?
* Moving `PyCore.create_module()` and `PyCore.create_package()`?
* Using GPLv3 from 0.7?


Remaining Small Stories
=======================

Base:

* Multiple ropes on one project; problems for objectdb and history
* Inline fails when there is an arg mismatch
* Evaluate function parameter defaults in staticoi?
* Recursive SOI; Go where the calls go with limited depth
* Adding ``do when unsure`` config to all refactorings?
* Removing ``pass`` when introducing factory for empty classes
* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow

UI and IDE:

* Inserting common prefix when using codeassist
* Renaming files, folders, modules, and packages in project tree view
* Completion in module entries
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Comments should be indented

Docs:

* Explain why rope does not stop users from performing wrong
  refactorings
* Add custom refactoring section to ``overview.txt`` file;
  Extract field refactoring
* Document why support for Python ``2.4`` was dropped
