Patched AST
===========

- ``(a + #)\nb)``
- ``a + ((b))``
- ``(a) + (b)``
- Handling new string literals u''
- Adding `_Source.consume_number()` and `_Source.consume_string()`
- Testing different forms of strings
- Testing different forms of numbers
- ``(a + ')')``
- Handling strings and docs
- Integer literals; 10l, 0x08
- Adding `patchedasttest` to testsuite
- classes with no super

* not loosing blank lines in the begining and end of the file

* py3k

  * metadata=? and classes
  * function annotations
  * // and /


Remaining Small Stories
=======================

Base:

* Better default callinfo selection
* Changing method to static method refactoring
* Multiple ropes on one project; problems for objectdb and history
* Inline fails when there is an arg mismatch
* Evaluate function parameter defaults in staticoi?
* Recursive SOI; Go where the calls go with limited depth
* ``match_when_unsure`` project config?
* Adding ``do when unsure`` config to all refactorings?
* Removing ``pass`` when introducing factory for empty classes
* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow

UI and IDE:

* Renaming normal files, folders, modules, and packages in project tree view
* Completion in module entries
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Comments should be indented

Docs:

* More documentation for using rope as a library
* Document features and organize them
* Describe why rope does not stop the user from performing wrong
  refactorings
