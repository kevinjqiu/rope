Small Stories
=============

- Interrupting refactorings when they are being done; performed but
  not added to the undolist

  - Adding interrupts option for constructing `TaskHandle`\s

* Should we call `pycore.resource_to_pyobject()` for all modules
* The ability to limit the files to restructure
* Caching `CodeTemplate.substitute()`?
* CheckingFinder and ``{'?a': '?b'}`` checks?
* Only scanning selected region for matches
* Consider filling python source


Remaining Small Stories
=======================

Base:

* Better default callinfo selection
* Multiple ropes on one project; problems for objectdb and history
* Inline fails when there is an arg mismatch
* Evaluate function parameter defaults in staticoi?
* Recursive SOI; Go where the calls go with limited depth
* Adding ``do when unsure`` config to all refactorings?
* Removing ``pass`` when introducing factory for empty classes
* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow

UI and IDE:

* Inserting common prefix when using codeassist
* Renaming normal files, folders, modules, and packages in project tree view
* Completion in module entries
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Comments should be indented

Docs:

* More documentation for using rope as a library
* Document features and organize them
* Describe why rope does not stop the user from performing wrong
  refactorings
