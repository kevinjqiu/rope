Small Stories
=============

- Replacing PythonCodeAssist with a function; how to handle templates
- Moving codeassist from editingtools
- Fix UI for proposing completions
- Cannot goto definition in show occurrences menu

* Extract method ignored some parameters! ``f(1, 2)`` matches ``f(1)``
* Replacing `Proposals` with a tuple?
* Setting `TemplateProposal.kind` to be 'template'

* Refactor codeanalyze
* Adding an option to inline not to remove the definition
* Renaming ``rope.py`` to ``ropeide.py`` and ``~/.rope`` to
  ``~/.ropeide.py``?
* Changing the default font on linux to courier?
* Lots of exceptions for `PyFunction`
* Commenting based on the line of syntax error in codeassist?
* Adding restructuring scope; local scope, module, all files?
* Better search triggering in find type dialog
* Changing `codeanalyze.WordFinder` to use ASTs?
* Refactoring codeanalyze; lots of estimations
* Assignment to parameters in inline method
* Assignment to parameter warning

* Extracting subexpressions; look at `extracttest` for more info
* Remove ``change occurreces`` refactoring?
* Changing version format?
* Using similarfinder in introduce_parameter?
* Should we move generate to `rope.base.refactor`?
* Moving `PyCore.create_module()` and `PyCore.create_package()`?
* Using GPLv3 from 0.7?


Remaining Small Stories
=======================

Base:

* Multiple ropes on one project; problems for objectdb and history
* Inline fails when there is an arg mismatch
* Evaluate function parameter defaults in staticoi?
* Recursive SOI; Go where the calls go with limited depth
* Adding ``do when unsure`` config to all refactorings?
* Removing ``pass`` when introducing factory for empty classes
* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow

UI and IDE:

* Inserting common prefix when using codeassist
* Renaming files, folders, modules, and packages in project tree view
* Completion in module entries
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Comments should be indented

Docs:

* Explain why rope does not stop users from performing wrong
  refactorings
* Add custom refactoring section to ``overview.txt`` file;
  Extract field refactoring
* Document why support for Python ``2.4`` was dropped
