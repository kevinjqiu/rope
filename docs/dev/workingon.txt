Small Stories
=============

- Moving Methods

  - Adding to the UI
  - Separating `MoveModule` and `MoveGlobal`
  - Nonexistent attribute
  - Unknown attribute type
  - Adding imports? Only when moving to another module
  - Adding methods to a class with ``pass`` body

- Default name for new method
- Inlining the last method of a class
- In the ``README.txt`` mention how to change the keybinding

* A completing text widget for dialogs; `Completing(name, list, handle)`
* Do `get_body()` and `get_body_region()` belong to `PyFunction`?
* Does `get_definition_info()` belong to `PyFunction`?
* Moving static and class methods
* Inlining methods with decorators
* Decorators and method refactorings
* Unifying ``x.get_type() == get_base_type('y')``, ``isinstance(x, PyY)``
* Finding unused variables
* Document how to move fields
* Adding codeassist templates in ``~/.rope``?


Remaining Small Stories
=======================

Base:

* Docs for builtin functions and properties
* Lambdas as functions; consider their parameters
* Sorting names in from import list
* When running `inlinetest` modules we get
  ``Exception exceptions.SystemError: 'error return without exception set'
    in <generator object at 0xb7173aec> ignored``
* Only saving diffs in `ChangeContents`
* Undoing `RemoveResource`; It's not used by refactorings
* Caching calculated parameters and returned object in `PyFunction`\s
* Allowing running code to call rope functions while rope is running?
* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow
* Extract constant
* `PyClass.superclasses` should be concluded data
* Handling `AssList` for inline variable and encapsulate field
* Import addition when adding a relative to an absolute import

UI and IDE:

* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Showing properties in quick outline
* Changing ``C-a C-a`` to move to the first character in the line
* ``M-a`` and ``M-e``
* Changing open project dialog
* Comments should be indented
* Decide when to use `difflib` in `Editor.set_text` based on the
  number of changes
* Better move dialog; complete modules names; use `editor._CompletionListHandle`

Others:

* Separating UI and functional tests from unit tests
* Better `ropetest` package structure
