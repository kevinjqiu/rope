'Rename When Unsure' Option
===========================

- Binding next/prev page keys in show pydoc
- Adding `UnboundPyName`

* Is throwing `IsBeingInferredException` a good thing?  Can't we
  return `get_unknown()` instead?
* Evaluate function parameter defaults in staticoi?


Remaining Small Stories
=======================

Base:

* ``enable_doi`` config
* Sorting names in from import list
* When running `inlinetest` modules we get
  ``Exception exceptions.SystemError: 'error return without exception set'
    in <generator object at 0xb7173aec> ignored``
* Only saving diffs in `ChangeContents`
* Undoing `RemoveResource`; It's not used by refactorings
* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow
* `PyClass.superclasses` should be concluded data
* Handling `AssList` for inline variable and encapsulate field
* Import addition when adding a relative to an absolute import

UI and IDE:

* Completion in module entries
* Faster find file in large projects
* A completing text widget for dialogs; `Completing(name, list, handle)`
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Showing properties in quick outline
* Changing ``C-a C-a`` to move to the first character in the line
* ``M-a`` and ``M-e``
* ``C-l`` and ``M-r``
* Comments should be indented
* Decide when to use `difflib` in `Editor.set_text` based on the
  number of changes

Docs:

* Document how to move fields
* Describe why rope does not stop the user from performing wrong
  refactorings

Others:

* Separating UI and functional tests from unit tests
* Better `ropetest` package structure
