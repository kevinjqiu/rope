Small Stories
=============

- Not waiting on stoppable task runner dialog
- Adding `PyFunction.get_kind()`
- Moving static method detection to a common place; extract,
  funcionutils, staticoi
- Problems with cache in inline for returns

* Remove `extract._get_method_kind()`
* object inference and ``self`` argument; it gets the value of
  subclasses

* What to do with files that cannot be compiled when refactoring?
* Extracting subexpressions; look at `extracttest` for more info
* Remove ``change occurreces`` refactoring?
* Changing version format?
* Using similarfinder in introduce_parameter?
* Should we move generate to `rope.base.refactor`?
* Moving `PyCore.create_module()` and `PyCore.create_package()`?
* Using GPLv3 from 0.7?


Remaining Small Stories
=======================

Base:

* Multiple ropes on one project; problems for objectdb and history
* Inline fails when there is an arg mismatch
* Evaluate function parameter defaults in staticoi?
* Recursive SOI; Go where the calls go with limited depth
* Adding ``do when unsure`` config to all refactorings?
* Removing ``pass`` when introducing factory for empty classes
p* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow

UI and IDE:

* Inserting common prefix when using codeassist
* Renaming files, folders, modules, and packages in project tree view
* Completion in module entries
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Comments should be indented

Docs:

* Explain why rope does not stop users from performing wrong
  refactorings
* Add custom refactoring section to ``overview.txt`` file;
  Extract field refactoring
* Document why support for Python ``2.4`` was dropped
