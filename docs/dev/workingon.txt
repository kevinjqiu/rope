Change Method Signature
=======================

- Change method signature Dialog
- Changing `inline` to use new classes in `rope.refactor.functionutils`
- Preventing recomputation of `DefinitionInfo`\s
- Throwing exception when adding duplicate paramters
- Adding inline argument default dialog

* Changing signature in class hierarchies
* Adding ignored file patterns in projects
* Problems for inside generator assists
* Performing actions on individual functions or imports
* Distinction between refactorings that can be used by other
  refactorings from other refactorings; should operate on pymodules?


Remaining Stories
=================

* `PyClass.superclasses` should be concluded data
* Better `ropetest` package structure
* Decide when to use `difflib` in `Editor.set_text`
* Handling `AssList` for inline variable and encapsulate field
* Changing `Rename` to take an `OccuranceFinder`
* ``break`` and ``continue`` in extract method

* Considering logical lines in `rope.codeanalyze`
* Reporting unhandled exceptions as error dialogs in the GUI
* Better move dialog; complete modules names; use `editor._CompletionListHandle`
* Moving/renaming current module/package
* Extract method and return statements
* Import addition when adding a relative with an absolute import
* Caching `PyCore.classes`
* Handling `Scope.lookup` for ::

    class A(object):
        a_var = 10
        another_var = a_var

* `rope.exceptions` should only contain user exceptions that are
  thrown from public classes like `Project`, `PyCore`, `Refactoring`
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
