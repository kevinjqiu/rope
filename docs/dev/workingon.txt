Adding SqliteDB For ObjectInfo
==============================

- Adding `sqlitedb` module
- Adding `objectdb` module


Remaining Small Stories
=======================

Base:

* Changing method to static method refactoring
* Multiple ropes on one project; problems for objectdb and history
* Adding *clear objectdb* command
* Inline fails when there is an arg mismatch
* Evaluate function parameter defaults in staticoi?
* Recursive SOI; Go where the calls go
* ``match_when_unsure`` project config?
* Adding ``do when unsure`` config to all refactorings?
* Removing ``pass`` when introducing factory for empty classes
* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow
* `PyClass.superclasses` should be concluded data

UI and IDE:

* Renaming normal files, folder, modules, and packages in project tree view
* Spell checking on python source
* Completion in module entries
* A completing text widget for dialogs; `Completing(name, list, handle)`
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Comments should be indented
* Decide when to use `difflib` in `Editor.set_text()` based on the
  number of changes

Docs:

* Adding call for UI contributions section and interesting tasks
* Document features and organize them
* Document how to move fields
* Describe why rope does not stop the user from performing wrong
  refactorings

Others:

* Separating UI and functional tests from unit tests
