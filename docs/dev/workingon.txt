Saving Preferences
==================

- Allowing changes to be saved in no project
- `PyCoreTest.test_not_leaking_for_vars_inside_parent_scope`;
  For-loop variables leak in the parent scope
- Singleton `NoProject`
- Adding a ``Edit "~/.rope"`` action; ``C-x c``
- Changing UI modules to default to `NoProject` rather than `None`
- Providing code assists in `NoProject`

* Convert every `os.path.sep` to ``/`` in `NoProject`


Remaining Small Stories
=======================

High Priorities:

* Separating UI and functional tests from unit tests
* Should we stop when transforming local variable to fields when there
  the field already exists?
* Lambdas as functions; consider their parameters
* Docs for builtin functions and properties
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``

Others:

* When running `inlinetest` modules we get
  ``Exception exceptions.SystemError: 'error return without exception set'
    in <generator object at 0xb7173aec> ignored``
* Only saving diffs in `ChangeContents`
* Undoing `RemoveResource`; It's not used by refactorings
* Decide when to use `difflib` in `Editor.set_text` based on the
  number of changes
* Showing properties in quick outline
* Comments should be indented
* Caching calculated parameters and returned object in `PyFunction`\s
* Fixing multiple function definition problems
* Allowing running code to call rope functions while rope is running?
* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow
* Extract constant
* What to do if a file is removed while editing
* Problems for inside list comprehension assists
* `PyClass.superclasses` should be concluded data
* Better `ropetest` package structure
* Handling `AssList` for inline variable and encapsulate field
* Reporting unhandled exceptions as error dialogs in the GUI
* Better move dialog; complete modules names; use `editor._CompletionListHandle`
* Import addition when adding a relative to an absolute import
