Patched AST
===========

- tuple parameter unpacking
- handle Sliceobj
- handle long slices

* profiling
* py3k: How to handle both versions?

  * metadata=? and classes
  * function annotations
  * // and /
  * ...

* adding custom source folders in ``config.py``


Remaining Small Stories
=======================

Base:

* Better default callinfo selection
* Changing method to static method refactoring
* Multiple ropes on one project; problems for objectdb and history
* Inline fails when there is an arg mismatch
* Evaluate function parameter defaults in staticoi?
* Recursive SOI; Go where the calls go with limited depth
* ``match_when_unsure`` project config?
* Adding ``do when unsure`` config to all refactorings?
* Removing ``pass`` when introducing factory for empty classes
* Importing star and removing self imports; stack overflow

UI and IDE:

* Renaming normal files, folders, modules, and packages in project tree view
* Completion in module entries
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Comments should be indented

Docs:

* More documentation for using rope as a library
* Document features and organize them
* Describe why rope does not stop the user from performing wrong
  refactorings
