This file is actually a todo list.  Right now most of rope's efforts
are concentrated on implementing `base stories`_.  Contributions to
the `IDE and UI stories`_ are extremely welcome. Have a look at
`contributing.txt`_ file.

Base Stories
============

* Updating similarly named variables and methods in rename refactoring
* Extract superclass
* Collapse hierarchy
* Python C extensions
* User specified source folders
* Zip imports
* Pull up method
* Push down method
* Analyzing function decorators
* Introduce redirection
* Moving fields/methods to attribute classes


IDE And UI Stories

* Configuring fonts
* Showing syntactical errors
* Editor folding
* Variable indentation and tab size
* Having multiple clipboards
* Auto-importing modules
* Adding tool bar
* Replacement; M-%
* Remembering last open project
* Enhancing searching

  * End the search when some other key sequence is typed
  * C-s C-s should start the last search
  * Search history; BackSpace should go back to the matches found before
  * Starting from begining when end of file is reached
  * Showing failed searches

* Go to matching parenthesis
* Enhancing editor

  * Select all; C-x h
  * Fixed places for StatusTexts

* Indenting a range of file
* Auto completion type

  * Inserting or overwriting
  * Inserting common prefixes

* Showing function signature when calling
* ReST

  * highlighting inside pydocs
  * goto definition
  * outlines
  * codeassists

* Auto-completing function parameter names when calling
* Code contexts; context_finder.get_context(text, offset)
  This can be used when proposing code assists.
* Formating code
* Show PyDoc reST highlighting
* Enhancing module running

  * Showing running status in the GUI
  * Printing output
  * Getting input
  * Customizing CWD and parameters
  * Running last run
