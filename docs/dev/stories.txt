 rope stories

This file is actually a todo list.  Right now most of rope's efforts
are concentrated on implementing `base stories`_.  Contributions to
the `IDE and UI stories`_ are extremely welcome. Have a look at
`contributing.txt`_ file.

.. _`contributing.txt`: contributing.html


Base Stories
============

* Python C extensions
* User specified source folders
* Zip imports
* Updating similarly named variables and methods in rename refactoring
* Packages should be filtered; only allowing imported submodules
* Extract superclass
* Collapse hierarchy
* Finding similar statements when extracting variable/method
* Pull up method
* Push down method
* Replace method with method object refactoring
* Analyzing function decorators
* Introduce redirection
* Changing signature in class hierarchies
* Handling builtin functions and types


IDE And UI Stories
==================

* Configuring keys
* Configuring fonts
* Showing syntactical errors
* Editor folding
* Variable indentation and tab size
* Having multiple clipboards
* Auto-importing modules
* Adding tool bar
* Replacement; M-%
* Remembering last open project
* Enhancing searching

  * End the search when some other key sequence is typed
  * C-s C-s should start the last search
  * Search history; BackSpace should go back to the matches found before
  * Starting from begining when end of file is reached
  * Showing failed searches

* Go to matching parenthesis

  * Inserting or overwriting
  * Inserting common prefixes

* Showing function signature when calling
* ReST

  * highlighting inside pydocs
  * goto definition
  * outlines

* Better list and tree navigation
  Add filter texts and selection texts to trees and lists.
* Enhancing module running

  * Showing running status in the GUI
  * Printing output
  * Getting input
  * Customizing CWD and parameters
