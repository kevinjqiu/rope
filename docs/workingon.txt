Pre-Release Refactorings
========================

Goals:

- Go to definition for packages should go to __init__.py; for FilteredPackages also
* Do something for modules that can not be found
* Dotted not found modules



Before 0.2 Release
==================
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Enhancing highlighting
* Profiling to find the bottlenecks
* Document features added since 0.1 release
* Add a simple tutorial
* Better homepage


Remaining Stories
=================
* Not viewing inherited names in outlines
* Optimize SourceLinesAdapter methods
* Replace `rope.pycore._AttributeListFinder` with `rope.codeanalyze._StatementEvaluator`
* More work on WordRangeFinder._get_statment_start; merging with StatementRangeFinder?
* Having only one Refactoring instance for a project?
* PyObject and PyName equality checks; Value objects?
* Consider using `StatementRangeFinder` in highlight module?
* Directories should contain __init__.py to be packages in codeassist?
* Separating ui and core modules and packages?

  * Decide which modules are the domain and which are the presentation
  * Should editing tools access Editor directly? Which of them?
  * Specifing the type of each story; UI or Core
  * Dividing week time; 5/7 for core and 2/7 for UI

* The same pattern for module names; ~ing or ~ or ~er
