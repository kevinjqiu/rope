Release And Weekly Planning
===========================

- Reimplementing `PyModule.get_attribute`
- Star imports should not overwrite global `DefinedName`\s
- Imported base classes and `get_attributes`

* What to do about ``__init__.py`` and packages; Should we
  consider them as star imports
* Invalidating concluded data after running modules
* Caching `PyCore.classes`
* Function scope and concluded data


Remaining Stories
=================

* Transform module to package refactoring and relative imports
* `rope.exceptions` should only contain user exceptions that are
  thrown from public classes like `Project`, `PyCore`, `Refactoring`
* Eliminating `Editor.refactoring`
* Calling `sys.settrace` for all threads in `rope.runmod` module
* Adding ``show_what_rope_can_do`` file
* A keyboard shortcut for renaming local variables
* Function keywords and extract method
* Showing initial name in rename dialogs
* Faster implementation of `GlobalScope.get_inner_scope_for_line`
* Performing refactorings based on the object of the pyname
* Goto definition for ``# comment.\na_var``
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Slow `GraphicalEditor._get_offset`
* Do something for modules that can not be found
* Dotted not found modules
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
