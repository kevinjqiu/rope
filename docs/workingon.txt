Refactoring
===========

- Adding `GlobalScope.get_inner_scope_for_offset` to avoid using
  `SourceLinesAdapter` in find_subclasses

* Creating `SourceLinesAdapter` s are expensive; Having one in `PyModule`


Remaining Stories
=================

* Reporting unhandled exceptions in the GUI
* Better move dialog; complete modules names; use editor._CompletionListHandle
* Showing initial name in rename dialogs
* Adding ``overview.txt``, ``README.txt``, ``tutorial.txt`` and
  ``COPYING`` to help menu; Adding readonly mode?
* Extract method and return statements
* Function decorators and renaming attributes of self
* Import addition when adding a relative with an absolute import
* Test `difflib` for `Editor.set_text`
* Caching `PyCore.classes`
* Handling `Scope.lookup` for ::

    class A(object):
        a_var = 10
        another_var = a_var

* Preferring `DefinedName`\s in attribute code assists
* `rope.exceptions` should only contain user exceptions that are
  thrown from public classes like `Project`, `PyCore`, `Refactoring`
* Eliminating `Editor.refactoring`
* Calling `sys.settrace` for all threads in `rope.runmod` module
* Keyboard shortcuts for new features
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Slow `GraphicalEditor._get_offset`
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
