Pre-Release Refactorings
========================

- A faster test for out of project modules in rope.pycoretest

* Putting a plus for nodes with children in outline view;
  Needs OutlineViewNode.has_child()
* Go to definition for packages should go to __init__.py; for FilteredPackages also
* Eliminate FilteredPackage
* Each PyPackage should have

  * The list of available children; derived from `__init__.py` or imports/froms
  * An import_name function that throws exception if the name cannot be found

* Only looking in the holding scope range for renaming
* Testing all in windows

* Optimize SourceLinesAdapter methods
* Replace `rope.pycore._AttributeListFinder` with `rope.codeanalyze._StatementEvaluator`
* More work on WordRangeFinder._get_statment_start; merging with StatementRangeFinder?
* Having only one Refactoring instance for a project?
* PyObject and PyName equality checks; Value objects?
* Refactor pycore; So many kinds for Modules; eliminate checking module.is_package?
