Small Stories For 0.2 Release
=============================
- Better next/prev
- Handle ``something__``, ``__init__.py`` and ``__init__`` for reST highlighting

* Goto definition for ``# comment.\na_var``
* Showing version in about dialog
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Having only one Refactoring instance for a project?

* Optimize SourceLinesAdapter methods
* Slow `GraphicalEditor._get_offset`
* Replace `rope.pycore._AttributeListFinder` with `rope.codeanalyze._StatementEvaluator`
* More work on WordRangeFinder._get_statment_start; merging with StatementRangeFinder?
* PyObject and PyName equality checks; Value objects?


Changing Package Structures
===========================
* The same pattern for module names; ~ing or ~ or ~er

UI Modules:
  core, editor, fileeditor, indenter, highlight, searching, statusbar, tkhelpers
  uihelpers, editingtools

Core Modules:
  codeassist, codeanalyze, exceptions, project, formatter, refactoring, pycore, outline

highlight -> highlighter
searching -> searcher


Before 0.2 Release
==================
* Document features added since 0.1 release


Remaining Stories
=================
* Do something for modules that can not be found
* Dotted not found modules
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
* Separating ui and core modules and packages?

  * Decide which modules are the domain and which are the presentation
  * Should editing tools access Editor directly? Which of them?
  * Specifing the type of each story; UI or Core
  * Dividing week time; 5/7 for core and 2/7 for UI
