Refactoring
===========

- EditingTools should have a common construction location
- Removing GraphicalEditor.set_indenter, .set_code_assist
- More thinking about editing tools; Which of them need the editor directly.

* Better definition locations; hold the range
* pycore's getting fat
* editor's getting fat
* Refactor _ScopeVisitor.visitFrom and visitImport
* Folders and change_observers?
* Code-assist proposal name should not be so long?
* PyNames with None object
* Refactor pycore; So many kinds for Modules; eliminate checking module.is_package?
* PyObject equality check; Value objects?
* Removing duplications in tests in codeassist and pycore scopes
* Consider using StatementRangeFinder in highlight module?
* Updating editor when file changes at disk?
* Caching a few recent pycore.get_string_modules in codeassist or pycore?


Before 0.2 Release
==================
* GUI testing redux; make a ropefunctest directory?; rename ropetest to ropeunittest?
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Enhancing highlighting
* Profiling to find the bottlenecks
* Document features added since release 0.1
* Better homepage


Remaining Stories
=================
* Directories should contain __init__.py to be packages in codeassist?
* Code assists on relative imports?
* Python C extensions?
* Remote pair programming support?
* Separating ui and core modules and packages?

  * Decide which modules are the domain and which are the presentation
  * Should editing tools access Editor directly? Which of them?
  * Specifing the type of each story; UI or Core
  * Dividing week time; 5/7 for core and 2/7 for UI
