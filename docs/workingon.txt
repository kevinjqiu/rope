Refactor CodeAssist @ 2
=======================

- Only report scope in which the var is reported global, local, attribute;

* PyFunction.decorators and bases should be pyobjects
* Resource.remove_change_observer
? Folders and change_observers
? Code-assist proposal name should not be so long
* PyNames with None object
? PyObject might have additional information based on their types; visitor; checking types in many places
? Refactor pycore; So many kinds for Modules; eliminate checking module.is_package
? Not accessing pyname.object in codeassist
? PyObject equality check; Value objects
* Removing duplications in tests in codeassist and pycore scopes
* Move Project.find_module and find_package and get_source_folders to PyCore
* Move Project.create_module and create_package to PyCore
? Builtins and scopes
? We know the type of list and keyword args
? Consider using StatementRangeFinder in highlight module


Before 0.2 Release
==================
* GUI testing redux; make a ropefunctest directory; ? rename ropetest to ropeunittest
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Enhancing highlighting
* Profiling to find the bottlenecks
* Document features added since release 0.1
* Better homepage


Remaining Stories
=================
? Directories should contain __init__.py to be packages in codeassist
? Auto-completion on relative imports
? Python C extensions
? Better version number selection
? Remote pair programming support
? Separating ui modules and packages
  ? Decide which modules are the domain and which are the presentation
  ? Should editing tools access Editor directly? Which of them?
  ? Specifing the type of each story; UI or Core
