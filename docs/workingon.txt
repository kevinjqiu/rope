*** Auto-completing "self."s @ 2 ***

- Add project.RootFolder
- Using path separators when setting PYTHONPATH
- Package
- PyElement.get_name()
- Variables in global scope
- Variables in class scope
- Finding attributes set in class.__init__
- Accessing PyObject type
- Builtin types: Module, Function, Type
- Add Unknown type

? PyObject.info
    * Function types should have args, defaults, keywords attributes
* Better attributes names in pycore classes
* Classes inside classes
? Classes and functions defined in functions
? What if the element does not exist
? Getting children only when necessary, invalidating
? PyObject equality check; Value objects

? Don't look for local variable completions
? Add PythonHierarchy.create_element(Resource)
* Using os.path.normpath
? What to do for AssList and AssTuple
? Next/Prev words should stop at start/end of the line
* Change from-import code assist to use PyCore
? Move Project.find_module and find_package to PyCore
? Move Project.create_module and create_package to PyCore


--- Before 0.2 Release ---
* GUI testing redux; make a ropefunctest directory; ? rename ropetest to ropeunittest
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* More builtin templates; hash, eq
* Enhancing highlighting
* Profiling to find the bottlenecks
? Ready for announcing at Cheese Shop



--- Remaining Stories ---

? From-import might cache module global variables
? Directories should contain __init__.py to be packages in codeassist
? Auto-completion on relative imports
? Python C extensions
? Better version number selection
? Remote pair programming support
? Separating ui modules and packages
    ? Decide which modules are the domain and which are the presentation
    ? Should editing tools access Editor directly? Which of them?
    ? Specifing the type of each story; UI or Core
? The connection between ASTs, module hierarchies and type databases
