Single line extract method and variable
=======================================

- Exceptional conditions for extract method/variable

* Refactor `extract` module
* More tests for extract variable

* Refactor `rope.ui.refactor` dialogs
* Changing sourcetools.* to use logical lines?
* Refactor `importutils` module


Remaining Stories
=================

* Better refactoring dialogs
* Extract method and return statements
* Function decorators and renaming attributes of self
* Import addition when adding a relative with an absolute import
* Test `difflib` for `Editor.set_text`
* Caching `PyCore.classes`
* Handling `Scope.lookup` for ::

    class A(object):
        a_var = 10
        another_var = a_var

* Preferring `DefinedName`\s in attribute code assists
* `rope.exceptions` should only contain user exceptions that are
  thrown from public classes like `Project`, `PyCore`, `Refactoring`
* Eliminating `Editor.refactoring`
* Calling `sys.settrace` for all threads in `rope.runmod` module
* Keyboard shortcuts for new features
* Function keywords and extract method
* Showing initial name in rename dialogs
* Faster implementation of `GlobalScope.get_inner_scope_for_line`
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Slow `GraphicalEditor._get_offset`
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
