  What if the statement in current line is spread in more than one line.

- More tests for explicit and implicit continuations
? Transform big unextractible methods into method objects
- Not proposing variables defined after current line in the same scope
- Ignoring """ or ''' string content
- scopes_count does not work because there might be loops and other blocks


? Add rope.scopes module
? Completions for for-loop, except, lambda, with variables
? Remote pair programming support
? Completions are context dependant
? Separating ui modules and packages
    ? Decide which modules are the domain and which are the presentation
    ? Should editing tools access Editor directly? Which of them?
    ? Specifing the type of each story; UI or Core
? The connection between ASTs, module hierarchies and type databases
? Key selection for new module and package
