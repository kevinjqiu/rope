Dynamic OI Small Enhancements
=============================

- Not failing if some of the arguments cannot be found in `rope.runmod`

* Calling `sys.settrace` for all threads


Remaining Stories
=================

* Adding ``show_what_rope_can_do`` file
* Package.get_scope
* A keyboard shortcut for renaming local variables
* Function keywords and extract method
* Showing the initial name in renaming dialogs
* Faster implementation of `GlobalScope.get_inner_scope_for_line`
* Performing refactorings based on the object of the pyname
* Review `rope.codeanalyze`; module there seems to be many places to refactor
* Refactoring `rope.refactoring` module; removing duplication

* Goto definition for ``# comment.\na_var``
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Slow `GraphicalEditor._get_offset`
* Do something for modules that can not be found
* Dotted not found modules
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
