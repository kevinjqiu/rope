*** Auto-complete from-import imported objects @ 3 ***

- Add Project.find_module(module_name) which should return a list
- Resource.__hash__
- imports inside functions
- from module import *
- Add new TestCase to runtests.py

* Star in functions
* from mod import * should not import names starting with an underscore
* from package import package
? from name import *: loads everything without starting underscore or __all__
? Packages: First look in the __init__.py module for that name and if
  it did not exist, look for submodules or packages
? Reduce the duplication in visitors in codeassist.py

? Better version number selection
? Add rope.scopes module
? Completions are context dependant
? Remote pair programming support
? Separating ui modules and packages
    ? Decide which modules are the domain and which are the presentation
    ? Should editing tools access Editor directly? Which of them?
    ? Specifing the type of each story; UI or Core
? The connection between ASTs, module hierarchies and type databases
? Key selection for new module and package
