Renaming Global Functions/Classes
=================================

- Optimize `SourceLinesAdapter` methods

* Addition to UI
* Faster implementation of `GlobalScope.get_inner_scope_for_line`
* Performing refactorings based on the object of the pyname
* Refactoring `rope.refactoring` module; removing duplication
* Review `rope.codeanalyze`; module there seems to be many places to refactor
* Add run module to menus


Remaining Stories
=================

* Goto definition for ``# comment.\na_var``
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Having only one `Refactoring` instance per `Project`?
* Slow `GraphicalEditor._get_offset`
* More work on WordRangeFinder._get_statment_start; merging with StatementRangeFinder?
* PyObject and PyName equality checks; Value objects?
* Do something for modules that can not be found
* Dotted not found modules
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
