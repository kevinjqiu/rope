Go to definition; F3 @ 1
========================

- The definition location of parameters and attributes
- Go to definition with other resource targets
- Editor.goto_line
- Add go to definition to the GUI
- Testing go to definition for the GUI

* Refactor editor._goto_definition; not using Core.get_core()
* Refactor Core; Only use EditorManager when working with the Editors

* Caching a few recent pycore.get_string_modules in codeassist or pycore
* Refactor _ScopeVisitor.visitFrom and visitImport
* Folders and change_observers?
* Code-assist proposal name should not be so long?
* PyNames with None object
* Refactor pycore; So many kinds for Modules; eliminate checking module.is_package?
* PyObject equality check; Value objects?
* Removing duplications in tests in codeassist and pycore scopes
* Consider using StatementRangeFinder in highlight module?
* Updating editor when file changes at disk?


Before 0.2 Release
==================
* GUI testing redux; make a ropefunctest directory; ? rename ropetest to ropeunittest
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Enhancing highlighting
* Profiling to find the bottlenecks
* Document features added since release 0.1
* Better homepage


Remaining Stories
=================
? Directories should contain __init__.py to be packages in codeassist
? Auto-completion on relative imports
? Python C extensions
? Better version number selection
? Remote pair programming support
? Separating ui and core modules and packages
  ? Decide which modules are the domain and which are the presentation
  ? Should editing tools access Editor directly? Which of them?
  ? Specifing the type of each story; UI or Core
