Previewing Refactoring Changes
==============================

* Adding `Change.__str__` and `Change.description` or maybe using a visitor
* Which refactorings should have previews?
* SMELL: All refactorings have ok, cancel and preview
* Empty lines and scope ends


Refactoring
===========

* Refactor the refactoring modules
  
  * What changes the most? refactoring kinds
  * Designing refactorings for IDE's


Before 0.3 Release
==================

* ``overview.txt``
* Encodings
* Eliminating `Editor.refactoring`; Use editing contexts


Remaining Stories
=================

* Handling `AssList` for inline variable and encapsulate field
* Changing refactor modules to use `sourcetools.add_methods`
* Adding ``add_statements(method, statements)``
* Changing `Rename` to take an `OccuranceFinder`
* Caching `Occurrence` fields
* ``break`` and ``continue`` in extract method

* Considering logical lines in `rope.codeanalyze`
* Reporting unhandled exceptions as error dialogs in the GUI
* Better move dialog; complete modules names; use `editor._CompletionListHandle`
* Moving/renaming current module
* Adding ``overview.txt``, ``README.txt``, ``tutorial.txt`` and
  ``COPYING`` to help menu; Adding readonly mode?
* Extract method and return statements
* Import addition when adding a relative with an absolute import
* Test `difflib` for `Editor.set_text`
* Caching `PyCore.classes`
* Handling `Scope.lookup` for ::

    class A(object):
        a_var = 10
        another_var = a_var

* Preferring `DefinedName`\s in attribute code assists
* `rope.exceptions` should only contain user exceptions that are
  thrown from public classes like `Project`, `PyCore`, `Refactoring`
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
