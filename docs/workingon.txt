Rename modules/packages
=======================

- Handle ``from x import y`` in NameScopeFinder

* Rename module resource
* Updating editor buttons


Clean Up And Refactoring
========================

* Showing the initial name in renaming dialogs
* Refactor `rope.ui.editor` and `rope.ui.core` modules
* Faster implementation of `GlobalScope.get_inner_scope_for_line`
* Performing refactorings based on the object of the pyname
* Review `rope.codeanalyze`; module there seems to be many places to refactor
* Refactoring `rope.refactoring` module; removing duplication


Remaining Stories
=================

* Goto definition for ``# comment.\na_var``
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Slow `GraphicalEditor._get_offset`
* PyObject and PyName equality checks; Value objects?
* Do something for modules that can not be found
* Dotted not found modules
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
