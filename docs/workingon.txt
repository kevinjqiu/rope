Before 0.3m4
============

- Changing ``C-F11`` to ``M-X p``
- Better refactoring undo

* Refactor `rope.importutils`
* Refactor `rope.refactor.move`
* Refactor `rope.codeanalyze`
* Update homepage and docs
* Move module/package


Remaining Stories
=================

* Import addition when adding a relative with an absolute import
* Test `difflib` for `Editor.set_text`
* Caching `PyCore.classes`
* Handling `Scope.lookup` for ::
  
    class A(object):
        a_var = 10
        another_var = a_var

* Preferring `DefinedName`\s in attribute code assists
* `rope.exceptions` should only contain user exceptions that are
  thrown from public classes like `Project`, `PyCore`, `Refactoring`
* Eliminating `Editor.refactoring`
* Calling `sys.settrace` for all threads in `rope.runmod` module
* Keyboard shortcuts for new features
* Function keywords and extract method
* Showing initial name in rename dialogs
* Faster implementation of `GlobalScope.get_inner_scope_for_line`
* Performing refactorings based on the object of the pyname
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
* Slow `GraphicalEditor._get_offset`
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
