Renaming Attributes In Class Hierarchies
========================================

* Think about special cases for renaming
* Refactor `rope.refactor.rename`
* Refactor `rope.refactor.extract`

* Adding `ropetest.classestest` to `runtests`
* Saving active editor before "transform module to package" refactoring
* PyCore.get_all_subclasses

* Eliminating `Editor.refactoring`
* `rope.exceptions` should only contain user exceptions that are
  thrown from public classes like `Project`, `PyCore`, `Refactoring`
*  Transform module to package refactoring and relative imports


Remaining Stories
=================

* Calling `sys.settrace` for all threads in `rope.runmod` module
* Adding ``show_what_rope_can_do`` file
* A keyboard shortcut for renaming local variables
* Function keywords and extract method
* Showing initial name in rename dialogs
* Faster implementation of `GlobalScope.get_inner_scope_for_line`
* Performing refactorings based on the object of the pyname
* Goto definition for ``# comment.\na_var``
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Slow `GraphicalEditor._get_offset`
* Do something for modules that can not be found
* Dotted not found modules
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
