- Not proposing builtins and keywords when starting is empty
- Should we have both function and method?
- Setting better font for status bar
- Not auto completing only the words after dot

? Sorting the proposals
? Completions are context dependant

? Separating ui modules and packages
    ? Decide which modules are the domain and which are the presentation
    ? Should editing tools access Editor directly? Which of them?
    ? Specifing the type of each story; UI or Core
? The connection between ASTs, module hierarchies and type databases
* Better font selection on windows
? Key selection for new module and package
