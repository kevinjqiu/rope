Auto-completing "self."s @ 2
============================

- Better attributes names in pycore classes
- Introduction of PyName
- Nested modules
- What if the element does not exist
- Making modules from strings
- Imports and pycore

* Better names for making the distinction between PyName and PyObject
* Add to runtests
? PyObject might have additional information based on their types; visitor
  * Function types should have args, defaults, keywords attributes
* Making scopes using PyNames
? PyObject equality check; Value objects
? Getting children only when necessary, invalidating
? Classes and functions defined in functions

* Project.pycore
* Change from-import code assist to use PyCore
? Don't look for local variable completions
? Add PythonHierarchy.create_element(Resource)
* Using os.path.normpath
? What to do for AssList and AssTuple AST nodes
? Next/Prev words should stop at start/end of the line
? Consider using StatementRangeFinder in highlight module
? Move Project.find_module and find_package to PyCore
? Move Project.create_module and create_package to PyCore


Before 0.2 Release
==================
* GUI testing redux; make a ropefunctest directory; ? rename ropetest to ropeunittest
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* More builtin templates; hash, eq
* Enhancing highlighting
* Profiling to find the bottlenecks
? Ready for announcing at Cheese Shop



Remaining Stories
=================
? From-import might cache module global variables
? Directories should contain __init__.py to be packages in codeassist
? Auto-completion on relative imports
? Python C extensions
? Better version number selection
? Remote pair programming support
? Separating ui modules and packages
  ? Decide which modules are the domain and which are the presentation
  ? Should editing tools access Editor directly? Which of them?
  ? Specifing the type of each story; UI or Core
? The connection between ASTs, module hierarchies and type databases
