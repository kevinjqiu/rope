Encapsulate Field
=================

- Adding `Occurrence.is_written`
- Gets as sets
- Adding ``add_methods(pymodule, class_scope, methods)``
- Adding methods to the end of class scope rather than module

* What if performed on non-classes
* Performing encapsulate field in some other module than defining
* Changing occurances in the module that contains the class
* Tuple assignments
* `AugAssign` nodes
* Not considering keyword parameters as assignments

* Using properties for source_code and lines
* Using cached decorator
* Refactoring `sourcetools` module; pack methods
* Changing refactor modules to use `sourcetools.add_methods`
* Adding ``add_statement(method, statement)``
* Change local variable to field refactoring
* Changing `Rename` to take an `OccuranceFinder`
* Caching `Occurrence` fields


Remaining Stories
=================

* Considering logical lines in `rope.codeanalyze`
* Reporting unhandled exceptions as error dialogs in the GUI
* Better move dialog; complete modules names; use `editor._CompletionListHandle`
* Moving/renaming current module
* Showing initial name in rename dialogs
* Adding ``overview.txt``, ``README.txt``, ``tutorial.txt`` and
  ``COPYING`` to help menu; Adding readonly mode?
* Extract method and return statements
* Import addition when adding a relative with an absolute import
* Test `difflib` for `Editor.set_text`
* Caching `PyCore.classes`
* Handling `Scope.lookup` for ::

    class A(object):
        a_var = 10
        another_var = a_var

* Preferring `DefinedName`\s in attribute code assists
* `rope.exceptions` should only contain user exceptions that are
  thrown from public classes like `Project`, `PyCore`, `Refactoring`
* Eliminating `Editor.refactoring`; Use editing contexts
* Calling `sys.settrace` for all threads in `rope.runmod` module
* Goto definition for ``"# comment.\na_var"``
