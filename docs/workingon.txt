Refactoring UI Modules
======================

* Should Menu cascades be made automatically?
* Define the responsibility of `Core` class

  * Providing an interface to the plug-ins
  * Providing methods for controlling rope?

* Moving code assist ui dialogs to `rope.ui.codeassist` module
* Moving refactoring ui dialogs to `rope.ui.refactorings` module


Remaining Stories
=================

* A keyboard shortcut for renaming local variables
* Showing the initial name in renaming dialogs
* Faster implementation of `GlobalScope.get_inner_scope_for_line`
* Performing refactorings based on the object of the pyname
* Review `rope.codeanalyze`; module there seems to be many places to refactor
* Refactoring `rope.refactoring` module; removing duplication

* Goto definition for ``# comment.\na_var``
* Better editor changing dialog; use uihelpers module
* Slow `GraphicalEditor._get_offset`
* Do something for modules that can not be found
* Dotted not found modules
* GUI testing redux; make a functests directory?; rename ropetest to unittests?
