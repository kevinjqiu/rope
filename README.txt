 rope, a python refactoring IDE and library ...
================================================


Overview
========

`rope`_ is a python refactoring IDE and library.  The IDE uses the
library to provide features like refactoring, code assist, and
auto-completion.  It is written in python.  The IDE uses `Tkinter`
library.

To change rope IDE preferences edit your ``~/.rope`` (which is created
the first time you start rope).  To change your project preferences
edit ``$PROJECT_ROOT/.ropeproject/config.py`` where ``$PROJECT_ROOT``
is the root folder of your project (this file is created the first
time you open a project).

If you don't like rope's default emacs-like keybinding, edit the
default ``~/.rope`` file and change `i_like_emacs` variable to
`False`.


Project Road Map
================

The main motive for starting this project was the lack of good
refactoring tools for Python programming language.  Refactoring
programs like "bicycle repair man" aren't reliable due to type
inference problems and they support a limited number of refactorings.
*Rope* tries to improve these limitations.

* Why an IDE and not a standalone library or program?

As Don Roberts one of the writers of the "Refactoring Browser" for
smalltalk writes:

  "An early implementation of the Refactoring Browser for Smalltalk
  was a separate tool from the standard Smalltalk development tools.
  What we found was that no one used it.  We did not even use it
  ourselves.  Once we integrated the refactorings directly into the
  Smalltalk Browser, we used them extensively."

The main goal of *rope* is to concentrate on the type inference and
refactoring of python programs and not a state of art IDE (At least
not in the first phase).  The type inference and refactoring parts
will not be dependent on *rope* IDE and if successful, will be
released as standalone programs and libraries so that other projects
may use them.
